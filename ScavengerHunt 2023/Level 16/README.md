# Level 16: Terra Nova

## Problems

You cautiously step out of your damaged spaceship and breathe a sigh of relief having survived the tumultuous landing.
Having traversed a lengthy and arduous path, you ultimately set foot on Terra Nova, the planet for which you had done it all. You look around to find that you have not just explored a new planet but also...discovered extraterrestrial life. Before you lie a whole new civilisation, one whose likes you have never seen before. Crystalline structures that touch the sky but donâ€™t seem to end, houses that each have a personality of their own, their architecture so advanced it defies all laws of physics. Floating gardens showcase a plethora of seasons, crystal clear lakes adorned with bioluminescent flowers, and majestic mountains bordering the far side of the planet. The view is unreal, it is a seamless blend of nature and technology. You are lost in your amazement when it hits you that even with such development around you, there seems to be no sign of life. Your curiosity piques and you start looking around for anything that could explain this situation. In your quest, you come across a magnificent building that leaves you awestruck. A dome-shaped structure that is so simple yet beautiful. Its smooth surface reflects the surrounding landscapes. The majestic dome rises into the sky, with captivating curves and a grand presence that evokes a sense of awe and wonder. You are certain that you will find your answers here but of course, the entrance is protected. You see multiple NUSB chips lying on the ground near the entrance. Desperate to find the flag you plug them into your lapdown decoder.

## Writeup

We are given a folder with a .git folder, meaning we have to deal with git in some shape or manner. 

Checking .gitignore
```
linux@DESKTOP-565N39B:~/TerraNovaLaboratory$ cat .gitignore
...

# Important confidential lab files should stay local
*.txt

...
```

So there must be some text files that have been ignored.

We have two interesting commits that we can check out. We can try to revert right before and onto them and check their diff to see anything that might be having the flag.

+We the people of TerraNova believe in utmost throughput. Conquering the "91" galaxies by using the might one of the highest effeciency bases is what we are born to do.

```
Alright now we can see a code and we see use of base and 91. Our best guess is the above code in encoded into base91. Decoding it we get
