The ssh portal immedieatly kicks us out on login. But when we look in ssh's manpage we see there is a `-t` option to Force pseudo-terminal allocation. we can use this to push a command

```
linux@DESKTOP-565N39B:~$ ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -t "cat readme"
                         _                     _ _ _
                        | |__   __ _ _ __   __| (_) |_
                        | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __|
                        | |_) | (_| | | | | (_| | | |_
