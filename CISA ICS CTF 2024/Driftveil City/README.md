# Driftveil Introduction

Driftveil City is a small city on the coast and has been experiencing issues with various ICS protocols used within their city infrastructure.

Driftveil's security operations center (SOC) has prioritized the following issues to be addressed as soon as possible:

- Learning to DRIFT: parsing and extracting PLC data from Driftveil's custom ICS protocol
- Fewer Wires More Problems: analyzing and extracting data from radio frequency (RF) captures
- Register the Dots: analyzing KAPE capture to find malicious activity on a Windows computer
- Enter city infrastructure as the flag to begin these challenges

Flag format: flag is city infrastructure. Example: city infrastructure
